### Introduction
Over the years, projects I’ve worked on, often demanded complex setup processes that I couldn’t manage to replicate. Worse still, when trying to replicate these setups on another PC, I’d inevitably run into dreaded environment errors, package conflicts, or dependencies that seemed determined to defy logic.

For ages, I found myself at my wit's end, unable to replicate set-ups or struggle with that one stupid error I had somehow fixed five deployments ago but couldn’t, for the life of me, remember how.

### Until I discovered Docker.

Docker turned out to be the solution to all my problems when it came to managing environments, scaling projects, and making everything portable.

It's really this simple:
```swift

//  ContentView.swift
//  easycommits
//  Created by Ali Al Abdullah on 02/02/2024.

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}

```


>Note: The Swift development enviroment is Xcode, Which is only available on MacOS

#### What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that is designed to simplify application development and replication by using containers which are lightweight packages that include everything needed to run the code.
You’re probably thinking to yourself why not just use a virtual machine?
Well, the reason that docker is so widespread is because of its lightweight nature; it shares the host machine’s kernel which makes it much faster and efficient 


#### Enter Kubernetes: Managing Containers at Scale
Let’s say you have an application that needs to be scalable, e.g. you have 100,000 users one day and only 10,000 the next, it would be a huge waste of resources if you were constantly using 100% of your resources when you only need around 10%. Well, that is where Kubernetes comes in, also open source and works hand in hand with docker. Kubernetes manages all your docker containers and decides whether more containers should be deployed or less and can efficiently communicate from one container to another to be able to handle surges in traffic. 


#### Conclusion 
While Docker simplifies containerization, Kubernetes is essential when your application outgrows a single machine or requires robust scaling and reliability. Together, they form a powerhouse combination that has revolutionized how modern applications are built and deployed. If Docker is the "what" of containerization, Kubernetes is the "how" of running it seamlessly in production.

If you're looking to take your containerized applications to the next level, learning Kubernetes is the natural next step in your journey.
