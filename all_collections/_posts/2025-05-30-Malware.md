### Introduction
Recently, All of my gaming accounts were hacked, which was very strange considering I have 2 factor authentication enabled on all accounts and a unique and complex password for each account. This led me into investigating what had happened that had lead to a security compromise which took over all of my accounts.

#### Crosshair X
Back-tracking my steps, made me realise that I had downloaded a version of a popular crosshair app from github the night before, called Crosshair X which surprisingly didn't seem to work...

Then, I realised that this was an information stealer that steals all sensitive information from a victims PC such as discord tokens, saved autofill passwords, autofilled credit/debit cards from chromium based browsers as well as cookies. Another feature is that they can also steal crypto wallets, passwords saved in password managers and so on...  There are many different variants of these stealers such as RedLine, Raccoon, and Lummastealer. These infostealers work through a panel to build the payload using custom icons for the executable, custom delivery methods for when a new victim has been captured and the ability to self destruct the malware based on various factors such as whitelisted IP's and regions. (Hackers have a distorted moral compass)

>Then I found out that the source code for some of these stealers has been actually leaked online and decided to take a more in depth look




#### Chromium based browers and the password encryption
These browsers store sensitive user data in a local SQlite database on the user machine, then this is encrypted using windows DPAPI (Data protection API) which ties the decryption key to the logged in user on windows. This database is stored the following location
```bash
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\
```

This streamlined approach allows developers to use the same codebase for both platforms, enhancing efficiency and expanding their reach. 

Swift's ability to seamlessly transition applications across Apple devices underscores its pivotal role in fostering a unified development experience.

#### SF Symbols - Focus on the important things
Apple has a standarized set of icons and symbols that are very easily animated, resized and maniuplated. This allows you to focus on the important stuff like functionality. SF symbols has over 5,000 unique symbols.

 symbols are organised by categories and also can also be animated in the SF symbols app so you can see what it will look like in the app.
 to insert this airtag logo in the code, we would use the line:
 ```swift
 Image(systemName: "airtag.radiowaves.forward.fill")
 ```


#### Conclusion 
In conclusion, my exploration of Swift and SwiftUI has reaffirmed the power of simplicity in the coding world. Swift's clean and concise syntax, exemplified in the provided code snippet, underscores its user-friendly nature, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced developers alike. The seamless compatibility between iOS and macOS further enhances its appeal, allowing for efficient cross-platform development. Additionally, the integration of SF Symbols adds another layer of simplicity, enabling developers to focus on functionality by easily incorporating standardized icons into their applications. With over 5,000 unique symbols and a well-organized library, SF Symbols streamlines the design process and contributes to a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. This practical take on Swift and SwiftUI, complemented by the versatility of SF Symbols, emphasizes the importance of straightforward approaches in creating effective and engaging software experiences within the Apple ecosystem.
