"Hey there, I'm Ali ðŸš€ I'm a student at Aston University who's into all things tech. I've dabbled in the world of `WebApps`, had fun with `Java`, `C#`, `PHP`, and more.

I'm not just stopping there, though â€“ I'm always on the lookout for new stuff to learn and play with. This site is like my tech playground, where you can peek into the cool projects I'm working on or have done.

Feel free to take a tour, and don't be shy to get in touch. I'm always up for a chat about tech or anything else exciting. Looking forward to hearing from you! ðŸ¤–âœ¨"
